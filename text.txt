Hello! My name is Ognjen Čanković, and I am currently a student with a passion for programming.
My journey into the world of programming started with my love for video games.
I discovered my fascination for technology while playing games and eventually began exploring how they worked behind the scenes.

Intrigued by the possibilities, I delved into learning programming on my own.
 I started by experimenting with inspect element and cheat engine on Facebook games,
 where I discovered the power of manipulating code to enhance gameplay.
  This sparked my curiosity and motivated me to dive deeper into programming.

As I continued my education, I honed my skills by building several non-working games,
 exploring different programming languages, and experimenting with full-stack website development.
  I have worked on various projects, collaborating with friends to create a 3D first-person shooter game using the Godot game engine.
   We implemented basic movement mechanics, added music, models, and incorporated various functionalities to make the game engaging.

Additionally, I have been involved in the development of a Java application called YACG,
 which simulates the popular card game Magic: The Gathering (MTG).
  This project utilized JavaFX to create a visual interface and implemented features such as card drawing and basic gameplay mechanics.

Alongside my programming endeavors, I have a strong affinity for strategic games like chess, MTG, Europa Universalis IV, Hearts of Iron IV, and Sid Meier's Civilization series.
 These games allow me to exercise my problem-solving skills and strategic thinking abilities.

Furthermore, I am an avid learner and enjoy expanding my knowledge in various subjects.
 I regularly watch educational videos from sources like MIT OpenCourseWare and engage with topics such as physics,
  mathematics, economics, geopolitics, and psychology, particularly the Jungian personality theory.

In terms of technical skills, I am proficient in languages like C, C++, git, and Java.
 I also have experience with Python and its libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data analysis.
  I have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of machine learning, including regression, classification, and working with various models.
   Additionally, I am eager to learn and explore new programming languages and technologies.

Outside of programming, I have a keen interest in subjects like economics, geopolitics, and mathematics.
 I enjoy listening to lectures from prestigious institutions such as MIT and Harvard.
  Moreover, I engage in recreational activities like playing MTG, lichess, and CS:GO,
   as well as immersing myself in strategic games like Europa Universalis IV, Civilization series, and Hearts of Iron IV.

Thank you for considering my CV, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my programming skills,
 passion for technology, and diverse interests to future endeavors.
